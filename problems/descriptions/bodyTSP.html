<h3>Problem Description</h3>

<p>In the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), you are given a set of points and your goal is to create a route to visit all of them and return to the first city such that the total distance is as small as possible.</p>
	
<p>In this version of TSP, you will be given a set of points in 3D space. These points all have integer coordinates between -100 and 100. Each point also comes with an index, which you will use for ordering the points.</p>

<h3>Problem Specifics</h3>

<p>The input file will be in the format:</p>

<pre>
index-1 x-1 y-1 z-1
index-2 x-2 y-2 z-2
index-3 x-3 y-3 z-3
...
index-500 x-500 y-500 z-500
</pre>

<p>You will output a list of the indices of the points to visit in order. The indices should be whitespace-separated integers. An acceptable file would look like:</p>

<pre>
index-1 index-2 index-3 index-4 index-5 ... index-500
</pre>

<p>To aid you with the problem, we are providing starter packages which can be found <a href="problems/starterpackages/TSP.zip" download>here</a>.  The input file can be found <a href="problems/input/TSP.txt" download>here</a>.</p>
