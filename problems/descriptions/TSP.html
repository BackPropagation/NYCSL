<h2>Problem Description</h2>

<p>In the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), you are given a set of points and your goal is to create a route to visit all of them and return to the first city such that the total distance is as small as possible.</p>
	
<p>In this version of TSP, you will be given a set of points in 3D space. These points all have integer coordinates between -100 and 100. Each point also comes with an index, which you will use for ordering the points.</p>

<h2>Problem Specifics</h2>

The input file will be in the format:

<pre>
index-1 x-1 y-1 z-1
index-2 x-2 y-2 z-2
index-3 x-3 y-3 z-3
...
index-500 x-500 y-500 z-500
</pre>

<p>You will output a list of the indices of the points to visit in order. The indices should be whitespace-separated integers. An acceptable file would look like:</p>

<pre>
index-1 index-2 index-3 index-4 index-5 ... index-500
</pre>

<p>To aid you with the problem, we are providing starter packages which can be found <a href="problems/starterpackages/TSP.zip" download>here</a>.</p>

<p>The input file can be found <a href="problems/input/tsp.txt" download>here</a>.</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>
<p>You can use anything on wikipedia for reference. Use of the internet for algorithmic purposes is acceptable, but you may not copy and paste code from the internet. Use of websites such as StackOverflow, python.org, the Java API, and cplusplus.com is encouraged.  Collaboration between students is encouraged, but your solutions should be your own.</p>
