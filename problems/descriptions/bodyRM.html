<h3>Problem Description</h3>

<p>In the problem Roommates, your goal will be to create rooms of people such that the total RoomSum is as large as possible. No room can contain fewer than two people, because that would be wasteful.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Find the number of letters which are present in the names of all of the people in the room. Letters are only counted multiple times if they exist that number of times in every member of the room.</li>
	<li>Multiply the number of letters from above by the number of people present in the room squared to obtain the RoomSum.</li>
	<li>The total RoomSum is the sum of all Rooms present.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Problem Specifics</h3>
